# Master Data Management - Datasource Setup
---

This repo houses the code used to generate some fake data that's used to mock a workflow that implements a golden record repository.

This is the base that allows us to explore key concepts in the creation of a [golden record repository](https://www.informatica.com/blogs/golden-record.html)

- Data ingestion
- Data cleansing
- Data deduplication
- leading to the final golden record, single source of truth

This is a small piece of a greater project that explores how a golden record repository within a master data management can be used from the lens of a web developer's learnings
